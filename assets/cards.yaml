## Meta
#
# For things that are not keywords, you can use one of these as Meta:
# - Diseased
# - Thunderstone
# - Dagger
# - Frozen (frozen wounds)
# - Destroy (destroy effects)
# - Dice (involves dice)
# - Discard (involves discarding or searching through discarded cards)
# - Static (can gain the static keyword, but doesn't have it inherently)
#
## Localization
#
# The user-facing fields can be specified in multiple languages by appending an
# underscore and the language code to the end of the key. For example:
# - Quest: Bandits of Black Rock
#   Quest_es: Banditos de Black Rock
#   Quest_fr: Bandits de Black Rock
#
# The following entries can be localized: Quest, Name (Hero, Marketplace cards,
# Dungeon rooms, Guardians, and Monsters), and Memo.
