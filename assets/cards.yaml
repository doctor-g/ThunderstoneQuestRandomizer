# - Thunderstone
# - Dagger
# - Frozen (frozen wounds)
# - Destroy (destroy effects)
# - Dice (involves dice)
# - Discard (involves discarding or searching through discarded cards)

## Localization

# The user-facing fields can be specified in multiple languages by appending an
# underscore and the language code to the end of the key. For example:
